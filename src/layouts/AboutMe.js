        <p>
          I have advanced degrees in aerospace engineering (Sometimes I like to
          tell people I am a rocket Scientist 🚀). I get satisfaction and joy
          from creating things, or should I say engineering solutions to a
          problem. I have been writing code from a long time either for some
          university project or just for fun. I decided to try techy things and
          enrolled in an AI/ML course and that’s how my journey with tech
          started. I discovered web development and liked it more than AI/ML.
          Since than I have been teaching myself frontend development ⚛️.

          I have transitioned from the messy code I wrote for my side projects
          to code that is more readable and clean. I have learned to write
          docstrings, unit tests and ventured into the world of design patterns.
          I have good grasp on frontend and am starting to learn the backend
          stuff and aligning my learning path to become a MERN developer. I
          believe in small daily improvements and try to learn new things daily.

          In my free times I love to read books 📙 or try to figure out how can
          I bring to life some batman tech. Some days its unfinished projects
          but most of the days its batman tech that gets me out of bed.
