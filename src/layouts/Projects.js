            <p>
              Donâ€™t be mislead by the name, it is not a calculator made with
              CSS. CSS-Calculator is a tool to help front-end developers write
              CSS code. This is the first mono-repo that I worked on. The front
              end is made with react and express is used in the back end.

            <p>
              This was first react project. It is a pure front-end app created
              with the sole purpose of tracking the progress of various
              job-applications. However, since code splitting was not
              implemented and the entire code was jam-packed into a single file,
              it soon became complex and over-whelming. I plan to refactor this
              project as a monorepo, add additional capabilities and introduce
              all the development good practices.

            <h2 className="sub-section-heading">E-Store</h2>
            <p>
              This was my first serious react project, I intended to make a
              fully functional e-store but I soon realised it can't be done
              without knowing some backend skills. Although I improvised with
              json-server for the time being, I plan to refactor this project
              and make it my first MERN app. Since it was my first big react
              project, it has been refactored multiple times and the code looks
              a little bit messy.
